/* ── Topper composer ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A card topper the baker composes: an empty canvas they add text and shapes to, where a control
 * appears only once there is something for it to act on.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CANVAS IS THE 3D SCENE SEEN FACE ON — it is NOT a separate 2D editor with a 3D preview
 * beside it. Two representations of one object is the drift INVARIANTS #15 exists to stop: the
 * moment a 2D canvas draws a heart and the 3D preview builds one, they are two hearts and only one
 * of them ships. A card topper is FLAT, so face-on 3D and a 2D canvas look identical anyway — and
 * dragging the camera round shows the same objects standing on a cake, with nothing to keep in step.
 *
 * The grid is a scene object behind the work, at the plane the cards sit on, so it reads as a
 * drawing surface without being a second coordinate system.
 *
 * ── WHAT A SAVED TOPPER IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OBJECT LIST, NEVER THE BUILT GEOMETRY — the same call `baker_garnishes` made and wrote down:
 * a garnish stores its outlines and REGENERATES its fills, which is stated as the whole reason the
 * fill is not stored. Here the equivalent is that a word is stored as its WORD, not as the contours
 * cut from it: the payload is a hundredth of the size, and a later improvement to `topperShapes` or
 * to `offsetParts` reaches every topper already kept. `v` is the guard on the other side — if a
 * generator ever changes in a way that must NOT reach old pieces, the version says which recipe a
 * payload was drawn for. It costs nothing now and cannot be added cheaply later.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS NOT A PICTURE. A PNG would come back as a flat sticker: no card thickness, no offset
 * layer standing proud, not recolourable, and it could never be cut. The thumbnail is a THUMBNAIL —
 * the tile in the picker — rendered FROM the objects, so it is a true sample rather than a drawing.
 *
 * ⚠️ STILL TO COME, and named so they are known gaps rather than forgotten ones: placing a kept
 * topper ON the cake needs `design.toppers[]`, a renderer and a movable contract, exactly as
 * `design.garnishes[]` has; and keeping one needs a `baker_toppers` table and route, mirroring
 * `baker_garnishes` — whose own comment argues against sharing a table with something whose columns
 * would be half null. Until the client offers `saveTopper`, the keep button does not appear at all,
 * which is how GarnishStudio behaves when its own save is absent.
