// ── The look of set chocolate, in ONE place ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ THE STUDIO MUST SHOW WHAT THE CAKE WILL SHOW, and two copies of these numbers is how it stops.
// The studio drew the piece as a flat 2D stroke with no material at all, so it read dull next to the
// same piece on the cake — every choice made in the studio was a guess, which is the one thing a
// preview must never be. A second material tuned to "look right" would put the lie back, just
// slower: the piece would match today and drift the first time either side was touched.
//
// ⚠️ A THIN ROPE IS ALMOST ALL GRAZING ANGLE, which is why the drip's settings wash a garnish out.
// Fresnel makes a clearcoat reflect hardest at grazing incidence: on a broad drip most pixels face
// the viewer and show base colour, but on a swept tube nearly every visible pixel is near the
// silhouette, so a strong clearcoat covers the whole piece in white-ish reflection and the chocolate
// underneath never appears. Side by side, the studio showed near-black brown and the placed piece
// pale taupe — the colour was buried, not under-lit, which is why RAISING the gloss twice made it
// worse. So the lacquer comes down rather than up, and the env boost with it.
